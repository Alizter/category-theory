(* Wikipedia: "We can define the category of cones to F as the comma category
  (Δ ↓ F). Morphisms of cones are then just morphisms in this category. This
  equivalence is rooted in the observation that a natural map between constant
  functors Δ(N), Δ(M) corresponds to a morphism between N and M. In this
  sense, the diagonal functor acts trivially on arrows. In similar vein,
  writing down the definition of a natural map from a constant functor Δ(N) to
  F yields the same diagram as the above. As one might expect, a morphism from
  a cone (N, ψ) to a cone (L, φ) is just a morphism N → L such that all the
  "obvious" diagrams commute (see the first diagram in the next section)." *)
