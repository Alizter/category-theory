** Define BiCCC characteristics for Cat and Sets
** Instead of HomFunctor, use the closed structure of Cat
And just apply curry to [C^op, C] ⟶ Sets
** Define equivalence and isomorphism of categories
** Isomorphism of objects is given by isomorphism of arrows
** Equivalence of objects should given by pair of arrows to isomorphic objects
An equivalence of categories consists of a functor between the involved
categories, which is required to have an "inverse" functor. However, in
contrast to the situation common for isomorphisms in an algebraic setting, the
composition of the functor and its "inverse" is not necessarily the identity
mapping. Instead it is sufficient that each object be naturally isomorphic to
its image under this composition. Thus one may describe the functors as being
"inverse up to isomorphism". There is indeed a concept of isomorphism of
categories where a strict form of inverse functor is required, but this is of
much less practical use than the equivalence concept.
** Move all instances not related to isomorphism or equivalence into modules
This will prevent Identity from being used whenever 'fmap' is called and I've
forgotten to provide the right context.

* Proofs
** Prod ⊣ Diag ⊣ Coprod
** Show that exp_prod, prod_coprod and exp_coprod arise from adjunctions
Some of these involve the diagonal functor.
** Awodey Theorem 1.6
Every category C with a set of arrows is isomorphic to one in which the
objects are sets and the arrows are functions.
** Awodey Exercise 1.13
Use the Cayley representation to show that every small category is isomorphic
to a “concrete” one, that is, one in which the objects are sets and the arrows
are functions between them.
** Awodey Exercise 1.14
The notion of a category can also be defined with just one sort (arrows)
rather than two (arrows and objects); the domains and codomains are taken to
be certain arrows that act as units under composition, which is partially
defined. Read about this definition in section I.1 of Mac Lane’s Categories
for the Working Mathematician, and do the exercise mentioned there, showing
that it is equivalent to the usual definition.

** Representable functors
Wikipedia: "We can generalize the previous example to any category C. To every
pair X, Y of objects in C one can assign the set Hom(X, Y) of morphisms from X
to Y. This defines a functor to Set which is contravariant in the first
argument and covariant in the second, i.e. it is a functor Cop × C → Set. If
f : X1 → X2 and g : Y1 → Y2 are morphisms in C, then the group homomorphism
Hom(f, g) : Hom(X2, Y1) → Hom(X1, Y2) is given by φ ↦ g ∘ φ ∘ f.

"Functors like these are called representable functors. An important goal in
many settings is to determine whether a given functor is representable."
* Type refinement
Comments from contextualMatters on /r/haskell:

With closed monoidal structure on presheaves, shouldn't it be possible to not
have to deal with point free style though ?

The term would look pretty much like haskell, but with a typing context to
account for the bindings (cf agda code in paper below).

It seems that in this work, Conal extracts from a haskell expression a "pure
categorical" term, in the form of an arrow between types existing in a single
context : the empty context. that is, closed terms. (Then he gains the freedom
to change the meaning of arrows to what he wants).

So he "steals" from haskell the surface language, but he does not "steal" the
binding structure, which is why you have to first remove the bindings. keeping
them means moving away from "type system as categories" and into "type system
as functor" :

In categories, this idea of a binding structure can be represented through
"pre sheaves", which associate to a context C the set of terms inhabiting a
type.

So there is a 2 level structure : above are all those "terms with context",
which is a category, and they can be projected onto a category of "contexts".
you can transport term above a context to terms above another by explicit
operations (corresponding in CS to weakening etc.. the point is those are
really of a different nature).

In the classical math literature, it's linked to the fibration approach. This
treatment for environments is one specific example.

That does not mean fibrations as a general concept is the panacea : they are
actually a very strong requirement, so there is some work to break them apart
in some weaker structure. ( fibrations like structures deal with many other
things (e.g. dependent types but not only)).

Atkey, McKinna etc use terms with environments and provide useful reference
here:

Mellies and Zeilberger provide a categorical view for this:
